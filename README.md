# classNodeAssignment
# Create a Node application that has a main file and at least 2 other local JavaScript files.
# One of the local JavaScript files should export a list of names.
# The other local JavaScript file should export a function that prints out a list of names (that can be passed in) with ‘zzz’ added to the end of it.
# The main file should import the data and functions from the local JS files you created, then use them to accomplish the task.
# For example, if the list of names includes “Troy”, “Martha”, “David”, the output should be “Troyzzz”, “Marthazzz”, “Davidzzz”
